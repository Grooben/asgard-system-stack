### Mimir
Mimir is our timetabling engine, providing the ability for us to generate our own timetables for rooms and labs. Functionality is currently in the works to provide a direct line of communnication of the University central timetabling system.

Yggdrasil is a content carousel display system, providing the ability to remotely assign carousels of custom content to display screens across campus. Yggdrasil has the ability to communicate with Heimdall and Mimir directly, allowing for the embedding of the lab availability and calenders into its content carousels.
